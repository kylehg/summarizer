good evening. there isn't a national poll in the race between vice
president al gore and governor george w. bush that shows a clear
advantage for one or the other with two weekends to go. according to
today's msnbc/reuters tracking poll, gore is hanging onto a
two-point lead over bush for the second day in a row. but all these
polls, it's important to point out , are within a margin of error

GROSSE POINTE PARK, Mich. _ It is deer hunting season in Michigan,
and hunters who climb trees with loaded shotguns have state
officials redoubling safety education efforts. 

Two men have been killed, and a third has been injured since the
hunting season opened on Nov. 15. All three accidents involved
shotguns, elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to
Michigan hunters _ shooting at deer from trees. The Michigan season,
one of the busiest, continues through Nov. 30. 

Firearm hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other
states with heavy hunting, like New York and Pennsylvania. But the
practice is only in its third season in Michigan, and officials say
it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about safety. Lt.
Suzanne Koppelo, hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement
division of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources &UR; , &LR;
said that since firearm platform hunting began in Michigan there had
been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice. Three were
fatal. Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was
killed on the ground by a hunter shooting from a platform. ``If
hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of
20-some feet, it would be almost a nonissue,'' said Koppelo. ``But
given human nature, that's not the case.'' 

More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the Michigan woods
this year, where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the
state's 1.9 million deer. The numbers reinforce the need to improve
education about platform hunting with firearms, Koppelo said. 

The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using bows and
arrows. Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the
woods, they wait quietly, typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet,
and fire down at deer that wander below. 

Despite the hunter killed from the platform, Sgt. Larry D. Sargent,
hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division,
says the practice does offer one safety advantage: errant shots
typically thump harmlessly to the ground, rather than whistling
through the woods and striking other people. 

The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of
position. 

``It's kind of hard climbing a tree with a gun,'' Rob Williams said,
as he and a hunting partner, Art Bush, waited on a recent morning in
a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of
Detroit. 

For Williams, Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with a loaded gun.
He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope
dangling from his belt to his gun, which he leaves unloaded on the
ground. When he is secure in his stand, he pulls his gun up after
him and loads it. Sargent says this is proper procedure. 

One accident this year, however, illustrates the importance of
following each step of the safety procedures. A 16-year-old hunter
used a haul line, but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left
the gun loaded, Koppelo said. The teen-ager's gun went off and he
was shot in the foot. 

Others are hurt falling out of trees. Koppelo said that state
officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it
was difficult, since they relied on hunters reporting minor
accidents. 

``A lot of guys are embarrassed,'' Sargent said. ``They'll say they
fell working in the yard or something.'' 

Others, Koppelo says, do not want to report accidents for fear the
law will be changed. And she adds that though anecdotal reports show
Michigan's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm
deer hunting from platforms, most expect the practice to catch on as
it has in other states. 

As Peter Thompson, a 16-year-old hunter, said, ``Usually the deer
don't look up.''

NEW YORK (AP) _ The price of a college degree continues to rise
faster than inflation, with tuition and fees at public four-year
colleges up an average 4.4 percent this fall, even more at private
schools, a new survey has found. And loans provide a growing chunk
of the extra money students need to pay for those degrees. 

Average in-state tuition and fees at public, four-year schools is
$3,510 per semester _ $148 more than last year, according to figures
released Monday by the College Board. On-campus room and board now
averages $4,960, up 5.1 percent. 

At private four-year colleges, tuition and fees average $16,332, up
5.2 percent from last year. Room and board on campus is now $6,209,
a 4.2 percent increase. 

Only public two-year schools, chiefly community colleges, stayed
below the current inflation rate _ but barely. Tuition rose this
year to $1,705, up 3.4 percent, the survey found. 

Private two-year schools boosted tuition and fees to $7,458, a 7
percent rise. 

This pattern follows an old, familiar trend, said Joni Finney, a
policy analyst at the National Center for Public Policy and Higher
Education in San Jose, Calif. ``Colleges and universities have a
very difficult time controlling their costs,'' she said. 

``These institutions were underfunded in the early part of the
'90s,'' Finney said. ''... But they've more than made up for lost
ground.'' 

But Stanley Eikenberry, president of the American Council on
Education, an umbrella group for higher education, said in a
statement, ``Given the large, fixed costs of most campuses, in
personnel and facilities especially, these numbers show institutions
are working hard to hold the line on increases.'' 

The recent increases push past inflation. The Consumer Price Index
rose 2.7 percent in 1999; the first eight months of this year,
consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. Last year,
college tuition and fees rose less than 5 percent. 

Despite the increases, college remains affordable and a good
investment, said College Board President Gaston Caperton in a
statement with the surveys. ``In both earning potential and learning
potential, you cannot beat the value of a college education,'' the
former West Virginia governor said. 

The College Board's figures concern the costs for 6.4 million
full-time undergraduates _ 54 percent attending four-year public
institutions, 27 percent at four-year private schools, 17 percent at
two-year community colleges and 1 percent at private two-year
schools. 

A majority of students need grants or loans _ or both _ but their
exact numbers are unknown, a College Board spokesman said. 

Last school year, loans made up 59 percent of a record $68 billion
in financial aid. A decade ago, loans made up just over 41 percent
of student financial help. 

The pool of money from federal, state and school sources last year
was 4 percent greater than a year earlier, but 88 percent more than
a decade before, taking inflation into account. 

The New York-based College Board is a nonprofit organization that
administers the SATs and promotes higher education. 

It surveyed more than 3,000 schools to find out undergraduate
charges for 2000-2001. The companion survey on financial aid, was
based on federal, state and school statistics from 1999-2000.
Current grant and loan figures are not available until the school
year ends.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ All else being equal, Duane Roelands would prefer
to dash off short instant text messages to co-workers and friends
with the service offered by Microsoft _ the one he finds easiest to
use. 

But for Roelands, all else is not equal: His office, clients and
nearly everyone else he knows use America Online's messaging system.
Now, he does too. 

``There are features that I want and I like,'' said Roelands, a Web
developer, who likens it to the battle between VHS and Beta video
recorders in the 1980s. ``But the reality is if I use the better
product, I get less functionality.'' 

For this reason, instant messaging rivals like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T
and ExciteAtHome maintain their users ought to be able to send
messages to anyone else, regardless of what service they happen to
have. That's not currently possible. 

The companies are lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to
require AOL to make its product compatible with those offered by
competitors as a condition of its merger with Time Warner. 

So far, the agency appears to favor a more tailored approach. The
commission's staff has recommended that AOL be required to make its
system work with at least one other provider, but the requirement
would apply only to advanced instant messaging services offered over
Time Warner's cable lines. 

How the agency defines advanced services is unclear. They could
refer to features beyond text messaging, such as video
teleconferencing, the sharing of files or messaging over interactive
television. 

Today, consumers more commonly take advantage of the garden variety
functions. They type short real-time phrases to others, allowing
them to ``chat'' back-and-forth using text. Unlike e-mail, it's
instantaneous and gets the recipient's attention right away. 

People can communicate with international friends without the hefty
phone bills. And the service has taken hold with those who have
hearing or speech disabilities. 

Unlike the telephone, people can discreetly interact with others _
or decide not to. 

``It's communications that can be ignored,'' said Jonathan Sacks, a
vice president at AOL, which runs the two leading messaging services
_ ICQ and AIM _ with 140 million users. ``On the telephone, you
can't see when somebody is near the phone. You can't see when it's
convenient for them to communicate with you.'' 

AOL rivals say that if instant messaging is to be as ubiquitous as
the phone network, it has to work the same way: People who use
different providers must still be able to contact one another. They
continue to lobby the FCC, hoping to see the conditions broadened
before the agency issues its final decision. 

``It's really important to get this right before innovation is
squashed because one company has a monopoly,'' said Jon Englund,
vice president of government affairs for ExciteAtHome. ``It's
absolutely critical that Internet uses have real choice among
competing platforms.'' 

AOL has said it wants to work toward interoperability, but first
needs to protect consumer privacy and security to prevent the kinds
of problems that have emerged in the e-mail world, like spamming _
unwanted junk messages. 

Company officials disagreed that AOL's market share was keeping out
competitors. AOL executives cited a recent study by Media Metrix
indicating that the messaging services offered by Yahoo! and
Microsoft are the fastest growing in the United States. 

Why all the fuss over a free product that anyone, even those who
don't subscribe to AOL, can use? 

Some pointed to the recent demise of two instant messaging
competitors _ iCAST and Tribal Voice _ as evidence that AOL's
dominance could prevent choices in the market. 

Another concern is that AOL could use its substantial customer base
to tack on new advanced services and then charge for them. 

Rivals said the ability of various services to work together will
become increasingly important in the future. For example, as instant
messaging migrates to cell phones or hand-held computer organizers,
consumers won't want to have to install multiple services on these
devices, said Brian Park, senior product for Yahoo! Communications
Services. 

``You can have the best service and the coolest features, but nobody
is going to use it if it doesn't communicate with other services,''
Park said.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ Fossil remains of a 120 million-year-old bird with
unique feathers cast doubt on the theory of birds evolving from
dinosaurs, some experts say, but others disagree. 

Two Chinese researchers report that a fossil called Protopteryx _
from a group of flying animals called Enantiornithine _ includes
feathers that are ``different from those of all other known fossil
and modern feathers.'' 

Fucheng Zhang and Zhonghe Zhou of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
suggest in the journal Science that the discovery supports the idea
that feathers evolved from scales, like those found in reptiles. The
study was to be published Friday. 

Some researchers who oppose the idea that birds evolved from
dinosaurs embraced the new fossil as proof that birds and dinosaurs
evolved independently from a common reptilian ancestor. 

But others say Protopteryx adds nothing to the dino-bird debate. 

``There is nothing in the skeleton of this bird that disputes the
dinosaur origin of birds,'' said Thomas R. Holtz Jr., a University
of Maryland paleobiologist and specialists on bird evolution. ``The
fact that this Protopteryx has these weird flat feathers really
doesn't affect that issue.'' 

Alan Feduccia, an evolutionary biologist at the University of North
Carolina, said the Chinese study of Protopteryx ``is a hot paper ...
that directly contradicts the idea that birds evolved from
dinosaurs.'' 

The new fossil was unveiled the day after researchers announced that
another ancient Chinese bird, called Microraptor zhaoianus,
supported the dinosaur origin of birds. 

In the study, Zhang and Zhou described the feather and bone
structure found in a fossil of a starling-sized bird uncovered in
northern China, the site of many dinosaur fossil finds. 

The Chinese researchers said the feathers have some of the
characteristics of modern feathers, but the structure is more
primitive than feathers found on Archaeopteryx, the earliest known
bird. 

Archaeopteryx appeared about 145 million years ago, while
Protopteryx was dated as more recent, about 120 million years ago.
Microraptor, which was about the size of a crow, lived about 125
million years ago. 

Some elements of the Protopteryx wing bone and muscle structure
match those of modern birds, said Zhang and Zhou, but the wing
retains a claw found on some primitive birdlike animals. In modern
birds, that claw has disappeared and been replaced with a structure
that adds lift to the wing. Nonetheless, Protopteryx is thought to
have been a competent flier. 

Most dinosaur researchers believe birds evolved 150 to 180 million
years ago from a dinosaur group called Theropods. Researchers cite
fundamental skeleton similarities to support the theory. The
evolution of feathers, however, has been less clear. 

Some experts believe feathers evolved specifically to support
flight, while others say feathers evolved first to provide warmth or
protection from water. 

Fossils of three theropods bear hairlike images that some say could
be the early precursors to feathers. 

But Feduccia dismisses the theropod hair as ``dino fuzz'' and cites
the Zhang and Zhou paper as proof that feathers evolved from
reptilian scales and that this could mean that birds evolved
independent of dinosaurs. 

``Bird feathers are very closely related to scales,'' said Feduccia.
``It is clear they evolved from elongated scales. Dino fuzz has
nothing to do with feathers.'' 

Larry Martin, a University of Kansas paleontologist, said the
Chinese researchers' paper ``is the strongest evidence yet that bird
feathers evolved for flight and that they were derived from
scales.'' 

Holtz, however, notes that Protopteryx, with its primitive feathers,
lived millions of years after Archaeopteryx, which had feathers
almost identical to those of modern birds. 

``This means the feathers on Protopteryx were probably an
evolutionary reversal,'' said Holtz, adding that there are many
examples where such reversals occur in nature. 

``This just shows that feathers are extremely adaptable
structures,'' he said. 

Michael Novacek, a dinosaur expert at the American Museum of Natural
History in New York, says that the Zhang and Zhou study is
``ambiguous'' on the issue of dinosaurs and birds. 

``The fact that you see a resemblance between scales and feathers
doesn't eliminate dinosaurs as close relatives to birds,'' said
Novacek. He, too, said that evolution reversals are not rare. He
said, for example, that whale ancestors lived on land and had fur,
but evolution carried the huge mammals back to the sea. 

Holtz said the Zhang and Zhou study is important because it adds new
understanding about the Enantiornithine, a bird group that dominated
the latter part of the age of dinosaurs. 

``The Enantiornithine got clobbered in the extinction event'' that
killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago, he said. 

This was followed by the dominance of another bird group, the
Ornithurae, which later evolved into modern birds, said Holtz.

Swarms of jellyfish consumed so many fish eggs and larvae in the
Gulf of Mexico this summer that some scientists are talking about
the potential for serious future threats to commercial and
recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf. 

The jellyfish, a native species and an invading one, appeared in
prime spawning areas just as breeding season for many of the Gulf's
most important species kicked into high gear. 

According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the number of
jellyfish in the Gulf has been rising for at least 13 years.
Scientists say the jellyfish are exploiting three major
human-induced changes in the environment: thousands of oil rigs and
artificial reefs established to attract game fish have greatly
increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish, which need a hard
surface for spawning; nitrogen pollution from farm runoff and
industrial sources feeds plankton blooms, providing extra food for
jellyfish; and commercial fishermen take great numbers of menhaden,
a soft-finned, bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the
plankton. 

Dr. Monty Graham, a researcher at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in
Alabama, worries that with all these advantages jellyfish cannot
help but multiply at an astonishing rate. 

Making matters much worse, he said, is the advent of Phyllorhiza
punctata, or Australian spotted jellyfish. The giant species,
previously unreported in the Gulf, is a 25-pound bruiser of a
jellyfish native to the Pacific. 

Some time ago the basketball-size jellyfish established themselves
in the Caribbean. This summer, after apparently riding ocean
currents north, they concentrated themselves in the passes between
the barrier islands that separate the Mississippi Sound from the
Gulf of Mexico. 

The Australian jellyfish have now mostly died off in the Gulf. But
fishery scientists worry that they may already have affected next
year's fish populations. And scientists say the animals were
spawning prodigiously, broadcasting millions of their own eggs as
they ate the eggs and larvae of native species. 

Popular sport fish, including redfish, speckled trout, white trout
and Spanish mackerel, as well as commercially important species like
crabs and menhaden, spawn just outside the barrier islands. This
year, their eggs and larvae had to drift with tidal currents through
the jellyfish-choked passes to reach the estuaries that serve as
nurseries for the baby fish. 

``These things are incredibly efficient at turning the water over,
cleaning it of everything in it,'' Graham said. ``We're finding them
with 200 fish eggs in their guts.'' 

The newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that
involved swimming to the surface, then diving down to the bottom,
scouring the water of virtually every living thing smaller than a BB
pellet. After flowing through the jellyfish gantlet, scientists
said, the water was almost devoid of living things. 

``You really have two problems in terms of commercially important
fish,'' said Harriet M. Perry, director of the fisheries section of
the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi. ``First the
jellies are ingesting the larvae and eggs of these commercially
important species, and then the fish larvae must compete with these
incredibly efficient jellies for the same food source.'' 

Perry said she worried that the Phyllorhiza might become permanent
residents. Graham said he feared that their offspring might appear
in larger numbers next spring. 

He noted, though, that the newcomers represented a small threat
compared with the monstrous herds of native moon jellyfish still
swarming offshore below Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana in a huge
swath roughly 100 miles long and 30 miles wide. 

It is these jellyfish that worry Dr. Joanne Lyczkowski-Shultz, a
larval specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. 

Lyczkowski-Shultz said the long-term picture might be bleak if the
jellyfish populations continued to grow at their current pace. ``It
could be totally devastating,'' she said.

Booking Your Ticket: 

_ Fly nonstop. The fewer connections you make, the lower the chance
that you will suffer a delay. 

_ Pick airports with care. If you have to connect, choose the
least-congested airport possible; some airports, like Chicago O'Hare
and La Guardia in New York, experience chronic delays. Take into
consideration the weather and the season; an airport in the South
might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer
thunderstorms. 

_ Check times between connecting flights. Airlines often book tight
connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours. Assume
each leg of your flight will arrive late, and book connections that
allow ample time. 

_ Check on-time records. The Transportation Department requires
major domestic airlines to make the on-time record for every flight
available to consumers. You can check online at
www.dot.gov/airconsumer. That site also reports each airline's
on-time record for the previous month. 

_ Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times. Saturday is usually
the least-traveled day of the week; so are major holidays. Monday
mornings and Friday afternoons are peak travel times for business
travelers. Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be
delayed, because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on
airline schedules. 

_ Use smaller airports. Instead of Los Angeles International, for
example, consider flying into Burbank or John Wayne Airport in
Orange County, Calif., or use Westchester County Airport instead of
JFK in New York. 

_ Avoid electronic tickets. Though they are convenient and more
secure than an easily lost paper ticket, they are not transferable
between most airlines if you need to switch carriers because of
delays. 

_ Watch for labor disruptions. Check newspapers and Web sites like
www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor
strife, which often increases cancellations and delays. 

_ Leave a number. Make sure the airline you book with has a phone
number at which you can be notified of delays or cancellations. 

_ Use a travel agent. A good one can be a great ally in the event of
a problem _ and may save you time and money. 

Day of Departure: 

_ Be informed. Check your flight's status before heading to the
airport. Automated telephone services or airline Web sites often
provide more up-to-date information than do ticket agents. The
Federal Aviation Administration's Web site, www.fly.faa.gov, has
real-time information on operations at the biggest airports. 

_ Pack defensively. Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush
in your carry-on bag. If traveling with an infant, take 24 hours'
worth of diapers and extra formula. When possible, avoid checking
luggage, in case you need to switch flights or carriers. Ship your
gifts ahead. 

_ Educate yourself. Find out what your airline promises to do for
passengers in the event of a delay. Print out a copy of the policy
from the airline's Web site, and carry it with you _ in case the
airline representatives need a reminder. 

If a Flight Is Delayed: 

_ Keep your cool. Becoming angry at airline personnel is
counterproductive. Sympathy for their plight will sometimes produce
results. 

_ Don't stand in line. To get on another flight, it is often more
effective to call the airline from the airport than to wait at the
ticket counter. Carry a cell phone; if delays are widespread, public
telephones may be in demand. 

_ Check the competition. If another airline has seats to your
destination, ask your airline to endorse your ticket to the other
line. 

_ Get what you paid for. If you paid full fare or are a high-mileage
frequent flier, let the airline know. Your odds of getting a seat on
the next flight out will increase, or the airline might pay for your
hotel, if you are delayed overnight. 

_ Consider driving. If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile
hop, renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a
delay. 

Getting Even: 

_ Write a letter. The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer
complaints within 60 days. They almost always offer a refund,
reimbursement of expenses, a discount on your next ticket _ or all
three. Be sure to save the relevant paperwork. 

_ Make it a federal case. Send a copy of your letter to Washington.
Complaints are charged against each airline in the Transportation
Department's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and serve as a basis
for rule making and enforcement action. Write to:

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call
for a ``fresh start after a season of cynicism,'' Gov. George W.
Bush ended his quest for the presidency Monday on a nearly identical
note, pledging to purge Washington of what he cast as a crippling
discord. 

The course that Bush charted over his final hours on the campaign
trail, plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw
electoral arithmetic, left no doubt about where he placed the blame
for that atmosphere. His first major rally was in Tennessee and his
last was planned for Arkansas, the home states, respectively, of
Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton. 

The Texas governor's words made equally clear that he saw himself as
the country's best hope for bridging ideological divides, healing
partisan wounds and making sure that Americans could gaze upon the
White House with unfettered respect. 

``There's a better day ahead if we have a leader who's willing to
unite the country, to bring people together, to elevate the people's
business above everyday politics,'' Bush said at a rally inside a
hangar at the airport here, where supporters' chants evoked the
nearness of the moment of decision. 

``One more day!'' they roared. ``One more day!'' 

What the nation needed, Bush told them, was ``a president who can
unite this nation, a president who puts aside the endless partisan
bickering that seems to gridlock our nation's capitol, a president
who puts the people first, a president who lifts this nation's
spirits. 

``I'll be that president,'' he added, a sentence that was equal
parts promise and prediction. It underscored the optimism that Bush
has, from the very beginning, sought to project to voters. 

His schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression
of that confidence. 

In between Tennessee and Arkansas, his campaign plane touched down
in Wisconsin and Iowa, and while any one of those four states could
wind up providing the key to a Bush victory, none have as many
electoral votes as such battlegrounds as Michigan and Pennsylvania. 

But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be
much more hospitable to Gore. By visiting them Monday, Bush
emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising
vulnerability of the vice president. 

He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him
from the important business of beseeching supporters to grant him
victory. With just 24 hours before Election Day, Bush in many ways
stripped campaigning to its essence: coaxing and cajoling, pleading
and persuading. 

``I want you to understand that I can't win without you,'' Bush told
a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in Green
Bay, Wis. ``I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get
out to the polls.'' 

Minutes later, he added: ``When you go out there and tell the folks
where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to
bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that
the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American
people, I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in.
They're going to come our way.'' 

In Chattanooga, Bush repeatedly needled Gore, which was much of the
point of going to Tennessee, where Gore is not at all certain to
prevail on Tuesday. 

The Texas governor claimed that Gore's decades of experience in
Washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making
him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal
spending. 

``My opponent vows to carry his home state,'' Bush said. ``He may
win Washington, D.C., but he's not going to win Tennessee. 

``He forgot his roots,'' Bush added. ``He forgot where he's from. He
trusts Washington. We trust the people.''

ST. LOUIS (AP) _ As Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore
prepared to perch on stools and take voters' questions in a crucial
third debate, the sudden death of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan cast a
pall over their final meeting. 

After talk of cancellation or a postponement for mourning, plans
were made early Tuesday to continue the 9 p.m. EDT event on
schedule, officials of both campaigns said. 

``In the end, there was general agreement that Mel Carnahan would
have wanted us to go forward,'' a senior Bush campaign official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

Bush's wife, Laura, canceled plans for a morning rally. Bush
campaign officials also decided to tone down a post-debate rally,
and were even considering canceling it. Gore hadn't planned any
events before the debate. 

Carnahan, a Democrat who was running for the Senate, campaigned with
Gore whenever the vice president was in Missouri and would have
accompanied Gore aboard Air Force II to a Kansas City rally on
Wednesday. Gore called Mrs. Carnahan with his condolences after the
news broke Monday night, aides said. 

``We're all waking up, honestly, to the tragedy and the pain of it
and the shock of it,'' Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman said Tuesday morning on CNN. 

The Bush and Gore campaigns did not talk to each other directly
about the possibility of postponement, but went through the debate
commission's director, Janet Brown, in a series of pre-dawn phone
calls. 

Eventually, Brown recommended that the debate should go on, and
neither side objected, according to campaign officials. 

The commission was to announce the plans later Tuesday, with each
candidate given time at the debate's start to say a few words about
Carnahan, who died Monday night in the crash of a small plane. 

With the larger bloc of uncommitted voters across the nation
apparently holding the key to the election, both candidates were
clearly mindful of the high stakes if the encounter goes forward as
planned. 

The informal question-and-answer format is one Gore is comfortable
with, and he promised on Monday to ``just have an open meeting,'' as
he had done many times before. 

Bush, who has less formal debate experience than the vice president
but whose standing in public opinion polls rose after the first two
face-offs, vowed to ``just tell it like it is.'' 

The debate, just three weeks before the Nov. 7 election, will be
held on the campus of Washington University. 

While the moderator will be the same as in the Boston and
Winston-Salem, N.C., debates _ Jim Lehrer of PBS _ questions this
time will come from the audience. 

The Gallup polling organization, assigned by the Commission on
Presidential Debates to recruit questioners, started with a random
sample of all registered voters in St. Louis and its suburbs, and
then screened out all but ``uncommitted voters,'' said Frank
Newport, Gallup's executive editor. 

The result was a group of area voters who say they could support
either Gore or Bush _ though they might be leaning one way or the
other. 

The theater-in-the-round stage will be informally set with two
stools and surrounded by 100 questioners and an additional 500
onlookers. 

Tuesday night's debate marks the beginning of the final stretch. 

And, with polls continuing to show the race to be neck-and-neck, any
stumble could have major impact on a contest in which both
candidates are fiercely wooing a dwindling band of undecided voters. 

Gore held a mock debate on Monday, inviting 23 voters to the
Innsbrook resort outside St. Louis to help him practice. 

``I'm going to do what I've done a lot of times in Tennessee, and
that is, just have an open meeting,'' Gore said. 

In 16 years in Congress, Gore held some 1,000 town meetings with
Tennessee constituents, and they've become a regular feature of his
presidential campaign. 

After an uncharacteristically muted demeanor in last week's debate,
Gore, was looking to do better this time. 

``I don't think you play it safe,'' said Gore's campaign chairman,
William Daley, previewing the Tuesday night encounter. ``I think you
try to be very natural and lay out in a forward way the compelling
reasons for the election to go your way.'' 

Bush had long resisted the town-hall-style session, but in recent
weeks on the campaign trail has been doing them almost daily. 

``I've felt comfortable about it,'' the Republican said Monday.

The latest in a series of storms spread fresh snow across the upper
Midwest on Monday, closing schools and disrupting travel. 

Up to 8 inches of snow had fallen by midday at Rockwell, Iowa, and
more than 4 inches had fallen on southern Minnesota. 

An area of low pressure area over the Midwest carried light to
moderate snow across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
northern Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. 

Schools and some businesses closed in parts of Nebraska. Snowplows
were pulled off the roads in northeastern Nebraska's Cuming County
during the morning because of hazardous driving conditions and
snowdrifts. 

Travel was discouraged in Minnesota as blowing snow cut visibility
to less than half a mile and about three dozen school districts
canceled classes. Wisconsin also had scattered school closings. 

A line of mixed precipitation trailed southward from the storm
system, spreading scattered show showers and freezing rain into
western sections of Kentucky and Tennessee. 

Farther south, scattered rain showers extended across Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Louisiana and into eastern Texas. 

Those showers were expected to move eastward into Alabama, Georgia,
and northwestern Florida during the night. 

Farther west, isolated snow showers were scattered over parts of
Wyoming, western South Dakota, eastern Colorado, and western
sections of Nebraska and Kansas. 

In the Northeast, a few light snow showers were scattered from
Pennsylvania across upstate New York into northern New England. 

Elsewhere, fog formed in some western parts of Washington, and
showers were expected to move into the region from the Pacific. 

Monday's temperatures around the Lower 48 ranged from a morning low
of 11 below zero at Phillips, Wis., to midday readings of 77 at
Oceanside, Calif., and Brownsville, Texas. The lowest wind chill was
58 below at Jamestown, N.D.

LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) _ The wife of Patrick Roy, the NHL's
winningest goalie, called 911 because she was afraid of what her
husband would do as they argued about in-laws, according to a police
report released Monday. 

Michele Roy was not hurt during the dispute at their home early
Sunday, but Roy admitted pulling a bedroom door off its hinges and
damaging another after his wife called Greenwood Village police and
hung up without speaking, the report said. 

The somber Colorado Avalanche goalie, accompanied by his parents,
sister and brother, stood with his hands clasped behind his back
during a brief court appearance. 

The initial hearing was postponed until Nov. 7. Roy remained free on
a $750 bail and left by a side door without comment. His wife was
absent. 

The judge also issued a restraining order that is standard in
domestic-dispute cases, which requires Roy to refrain from alcohol
and illegal drugs and possession of guns or weapons. He was
permitted to return home to his family and is allowed to travel with
the team to out-of-state games. 

After the Avalanche's practice, Roy read a brief statement, noting
that he could not comment on his arrest on the advice of his lawyer.
He also asked that the public respect his family's privacy. 

``Obviously, this is creating a distraction, and my wish is that
this distraction will be over soon,'' he said. ``I am thankful for
the support I am getting from my family and every one of my
teammates.'' 

Colorado players showed unified support for Roy, saying they believe
he will remain focused after an eight-game (6-0-2) unbeaten streak
to start the season. The team's next game is at home Wednesday
against Nashville. 

``We've always stuck together and we'll stick by Patrick,''
defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``We know he is a quality person and a
great family man.'' 

Defenseman Aaron Miller said, ``Until we find out exactly what's
going on, we're not going to let it bother us or distract us. I
think I speak for the whole team that we're behind Patty 100
percent.'' 

Roy, 35, was arrested and charged Sunday with misdemeanor criminal
mischief which occurred during an act of domestic violence. 

If convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in the county jail and
a $1,000 fine, said a spokesman for the Arapahoe County district
attorney's office. 

Officers responded to the 911 hang-up call at Roy's residence, where
Michele Roy told them the two had been arguing. 

Roy was honored Friday night for winning his 448th game three days
before, a 4-3 victory in overtime against the Washington Capitals.
He broke the mark set by Terry Sawchuk.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore said
Wednesday their only chance for victory in his contest of the
Florida election would be shattered if they have to wait until
Saturday to begin counting disputed ballots, and they began an
appeal to the Florida Supreme Court to do the counting itself,
immediately. 

The appeal was filed with the District Court of Appeal late
Wednesday afternoon, and will be submitted to the state's highest
court early Thursday, Gore's lawyers said. It essentially asks the
Supreme Court to take over Gore's contest lawsuit from the
slow-moving trial court, to count the ballots itself, and eventually
to declare Gore the winner if he wins the recount. 

But lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush said they had no intention of
allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight.
To that end, they persuaded Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order
1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach
counties _ brought up from south Florida and placed in the court's
custody. 

That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that the
judge had agreed on Tuesday to transport to Tallahassee at the Gore
team's request. And it could take weeks if not months to count them
all, the point that Barry Richard, Bush's chief trial lawyer here,
said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be
transported here. 

``We did it to make a point,'' Richard said in an interview. ``If
you recount any ballots, you have to recount all of them. Now, we
don't think any ballots should be counted, because the manual
recount of ballots is finished. But in the event the court
determines that some ballots should be counted, we wanted them here
so they could all be counted.'' 

Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots,
Gore's lawyers barely objected to the move, asking only that the
disputed ballots that might contain hidden Gore votes be separated
from the mass. 

``I know when it's futile,'' said David Boies, Gore's chief trial
lawyer, to Sauls. 

Nonetheless, Gore's lawyers were furious at the move, aware that it
represents yet another enormous barrier to their hopes for an
immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties
and a quick decision from the judge that Gore really won the
election. Even if the Florida Supreme Court should swiftly agree to
their request and orders the counting to begin by Friday, that would
still put them three days behind their original timetable. And
facing a Dec. 12 deadline for the state to name electors for the
Electoral College, Gore has absolutely no days to spare. 

``It's a stunt,'' said Kendall Coffey, one of Gore's election
lawyers, as he stormed out of Sauls' courtroom Wednesday, referring
to the request for all the ballots. ``They're trying to bog down the
case, the system, the clerk's office and everywhere else they can.'' 

The decision by Gore's lawyers to appeal the case shows how perilous
their situation is. By appealing, the lawyers were forced to put on
paper their fear that their case could be over if they cannot begin
counting ballots until Saturday. 

The decision to wait until a Saturday hearing ``is effectively a
final order denying all relief sought by plaintiffs because the
action now pending below must be completed before Dec. 12, 2000, in
order to offer any relief,'' said the notice filed with the Court of
Appeal. It adds, ``the court must allow sufficient time to complete
an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots, which is
essential for the proper resolution of the contest action.'' 

But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will
not be assembled in Tallahassee until late Friday, a day later than
planned. And even then, the hurdles are enormous. There will have to
be another hearing before the Florida Supreme Court, and Gore's
lawyers will have to refute three arguments to be raised by the Bush
team: There should be no more counting at all; if there is any
counting, it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots; and if
there is any counting of disputed ballots, dimples cannot be counted
as votes. 

If these issues are heard before Sanders, there will have to be
briefs, witnesses, and evidence on each point, which could take
days. If the Supreme Court agrees to short-circuit the process,
there will still have to be lengthy briefs filed, and the court may
need to wait several days before finding time for yet another
momentous hearing in its schedule.

ROME, Italy (AP) _ A little mountain village in northern Italy
buried five victims of last week's devastating high water and
mudslides on Sunday, the day a state of emergency finally ran out. 

Floodwaters throughout the region, including the raging Po River,
have ebbed, emptying into the Adriatic and revealing a rising toll
of damage. Some roads and bridges are still closed and could remain
so for some time, officials say. 

The death toll from the raging floodwaters and fearsome mudslides
reached 37 combined for the Alpine region of northern Italy and
southern Switzerland. Eighteen of those were from the Valle d'Aosta
in the Italian Alps. 

At the church of San Maurizio in Fenis, a mountain hamlet near the
city of Aosta, villagers paid their final respects to five local
victims. Among them, double losses for two families _ a father and
son in one, a mother and daughter in another. 

Amid the grief in communities throughout the stricken area, life was
slowly returning to something resembling normal. But thousands were
still unable to go back to their drenched or damaged homes and a
huge task of rebuilding lay ahead. Authorities estimate the damage
in the hundreds of million of dollars.

The Weir Group of the US recently signed an implementation agreement
in Beijing with Jiangsu Province's Electric Power Department to build
China's first large-capacity power plant with liquefied natural gas
as fuel.


Aixing Dan, director of the International Co-operation Department of
the Electric Power Industry Ministry, on this matter, expressed to
Xinhua News Agency reporters today that if this power plant is
successful, it will be a model for similar plants to be built along
coastal regions.


Coal, water, oil, etc., are normally used for traditional electricity
generation.

However, using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory
electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation
efficiency and lower total cost, is beneficial to the environment,
etc.

According to presentations, with this type of electricity generation
method, a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can
produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600
degrees centigrade. This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the
production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates
electricity.

Because of the efficiency of this construction method, the
electricity generated is relatively competitive in price.

At the same time, using natural gas as fuel will also reduce
environmental pollution along coastal regions.


The Weir Group, whose headquarters is in the US, is a large,
specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity
generation.

The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and
developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts.

Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US, the Weir Group
and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial
agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity
generation plant.

This power plant, which will be situated in Rudong, Jiangsu, has an
annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts. The investment
amount is 2.4 billion US dollars. The Chinese side holds 30% of the
shares while the Weir Group holds 70%.

According to the agreement, the Weir Group will be responsible for
the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by
the power plant.


Renzu Luo, managing director of the Weir Group, is optimistic over
the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity
generation along China's coastal regions.

He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market
development, liquefied natural gas has become the main material of
clean fuel used for electricity generation. When the gross national
product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan, etc., environmental protection awareness generally rose, and
all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by
liquefied natural gas.

As the gross national product in China's coastal regions begins to
approach this benchmark, it can be said to have had the conditions
for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial
resources.


John Weir, president of the Weir Group who visited China with US
Minister Brown and signed this agreement for electricity generation
plant construction in Jiangsu, held that now is the best time to
develop a project of joint circulatory electricity generation plant
with natural gas as fuel in China. Both parties, the US and China,
will invest more time, money and resources to make this power plant
project a successful model.

HONG KONG _ For most of this year, Asia's economies have performed a
sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates month after
month even as economists predicted they would fall to earth. 

That dichotomy was on vivid display here Friday: Hong Kong reported
that its economic output surged 10.4 percent in the third quarter,
and it raised its projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from
8.5 percent. 

Yet a block away, the International Monetary Fund warned in a news
conference that Asian economies could be hit hard by soaring oil
prices and turmoil in the financial markets. The IMF said a $5
increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow the growth rates
of Asian countries next year. 

``The prospects for growth in 2001 have weakened,'' said David
Robinson, assistant director of research at the fund. ``There has
also been increased political instability across the world, not
least in Asia.'' 

Several Asian countries _ notably the Philippines, Taiwan, and
Indonesia _ have been gripped by political tumult in recent weeks.
The Philippines president, Joseph Estrada, was impeached last week,
while Chen Shui-bian, the president of Taiwan, is trying to fend off
a recall vote. 

Even in more stable countries, like Malaysia and South Korea,
Robinson said the Fund was concerned by the haphazard pace of
economic reforms. In many countries, the banks and corporations
remain financially shaky. 

``We're still seeing chaebols in deep trouble,'' he said, referring
to Korea's heavily indebted conglomerates. 

But Robinson acknowledged that these weaknesses had not yet been
reflected in the economic performance of the countries. On Tuesday,
South Korea reported a 9.2 percent increase in its third-quarter
output _ beating the estimates of most analysts and extending a
string of powerful quarters. 

Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore have also beaten expectations,
while Hong Kong's growth rate was nearly three percentage points
above a median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. 

Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has been buoyed by an
unquenchable appetite for its exports, principally in the United
States. Exports surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter. Hong Kong
has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping
goods from mainland China. 

Consumer spending rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent, as
retail sales slackened from the second quarter. And consumer prices
fell 2 percent, extending a decline that began during the crisis. 

Ian Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce said the double-digit growth in Hong Kong and other Asian
countries masked their underlying condition. While the region's
growth in exports has been torrid, domestic demand has remained
tenuous. 

``We haven't built up our domestic economies yet,'' he said. ``The
recovery has relied almost completely on export growth. 

``If consumer spending slows down in the States, it will have a
devastating effect on Asia,'' said Perkin. ``2001 could be a crunch
year.'' 

Robinson of the IMF was similarly wary about next year. In October,
the IMF projected that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent in
2001, while Asia as a region would grow 6.6 percent. On Friday,
Robinson said the growth rate could be lower, though he would not
say by how much. 

A principal culprit of possibly slower growth is the dependence of
many Asian countries on imported oil. Oil prices have risen $5 per
barrel since the IMF issued its semi-annual economic outlook in
October. 

Asia has little control over oil, but Robinson said the region could
improve its economic prospects by calming its political waters. 

One bright spot in the Asian landscape is China, which is on track
to record 8 percent growth in 2000. Robinson said the main question
facing Chinese leaders was whether they need to spend billions of
dollars in public funds to further stimulate an economy that was
already expanding. 

Like Perkin, Robinson said Asia's future depended in large part on
the health of the United States. But he disputed those who predict
dramatically slowing growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the
American economy. 

``The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent,'' he said,
``substantially less.''

WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader may not be feeling any regrets about his
Green Party presidential campaign, but some visitors to the chat
room on Nader2000.org, Nader's official campaign website, sounded as
if a bad hangover had come crashing down on them. 

There was this entry, for instance, posted Thursday morning by a
writer named ``wreckz'': 

``I, too, feel I should apologize to America. I was duped. Ralph
Nader's enjoyment of all of this is an indication of a man more
concerned with vindictive politics than the future of our country
and planet. I am no longer a member of the Green Party. Instead, I'm
a member of the green movement _ a movement without Ralph Nader.'' 

Or this one, also posted Thursday morning, from ``Noni'': 

``I saw an interview with Ralph Nader today and he seemed to be
enjoying what has happened! I've never seen him smile so broadly. I
regret my support. Nader, you're a well-intending man and I agree
with most of your positions. But the symbolic run for the White
House has destroyed our Party and our cause. Very bad things are in
our future. You should not be smiling. And we, the misled, should
feel shame for what we've done.'' 

The remarks expressed fears that votes for Nader may have put Gov.
George W. Bush in a position to defeat Vice President Al Gore. In
Florida, where Gore trailed Bush by only a few hundred votes
Thursday, a shift of just a fraction of Nader's 95,000 votes could
have given the state, and the White House, to Gore, the most likely
major-party alternative for Nader's supporters. 

John Ruth, for example, wrote on the Nader2000 site Thursday morning
that he voted for Nader because he thought they ``shared a common
goal'' but that he was now regretting it. 

`` Gore (despite what you have said) is NOT an environmental clone
of G.W. Bush. Because of your actions and statements prior to Nov.
7th, we are on the brink of a Bush presidency. No money, no support,
no respect for you, Ralph, ever again!'' 

And in Oregon, a state that was still too close to call Thursday
afternoon, Nader won about 5 percent of the vote _ enough to cause
some Nader voters to feel morning-after qualms. 

Julie Quastler, 28, who voted for Nader in Portland, said on
Wednesday that she was feeling ``a little alarmed and disappointed''
that Bush seemed on the brink of winning the presidency _ suggesting
that she did not accept Nader's assertion that the two parties were
equally bad. 

``I'm just so sad,'' she said. ``Bush is probably going to be our
president and Nader didn't get his 5 percent. It seems like a
lose-lose end result in some ways.'' Winning 5 percent of the vote
nationwide would have qualified the Green Party for millions of
dollars in federal campaign funds in 2004. 

But Quastler, the development director for a nonprofit cafe, said
she did not feel guilty about her vote. 

``I voted for Nader because he was most aligned with my values,''
she said. 

Of course, there were also countless verbal high-fives among Nader
supporters Thursday who felt the Green Party had sent a bracing
wake-up call to the two major parties. 

``Stand tall and proud, fellow Nader supporters,'' said one message
on the Nader2000 site signed GO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SCAPEGOATS. 

``We fought the good fight for what we believed in. This does not
make us villains.'' 

Such sentiments seemed particularly strong in Florida. Dorothy
Byrne, a state coordinator for the Florida Green Party, said she had
been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from Democrats,
but has yet to receive one regretful note from a Nader voter. 

``I can see positives for the Greens with either Bush or Gore being
president,'' she said. ``If Gore was in, we wouldn't have to worry
about women's reproductive rights. But his record on the environment
is so abysmal I don't see how Bush can be any worse.'' 

Barbara Lange, the Everglades chairwoman for the Florida chapter of
the Sierra Club, said she and other environmentalists voted for
Nader because Gore had not taken a stand against the development of
a commercial airport near the Everglades. 

``I voted my conscience,'' she said. ``And I'm okay with that.'' 

Patricia Newell, an organizer for Nader at the University of Florida
in Gainesville, said that Nader had won far fewer votes in Florida
than his supporters had expected _ due, she said, to ``scare
tactics'' by the Democrats. 

``Anyone who voted with Nader on Tuesday knew exactly what they were
doing,'' she said. ``On the contrary to feeling guilty, they feel
very good about sticking with the candidate that they felt was
best.''

Since then, AOL's stock has fallen by almost a third, destroying
most of the premium the company had offered for control of Time
Warner. So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America
Online's chairman, Stephen Case, had bamboozled his Time Warner
counterpart, Gerald Levin, into taking AOL's shares at the worst
possible time. 

``Short term, anyone objective would say probably Steve got the
better part of the deal,'' said Larry Haverty, a senior vice
president at State Street Research in Boston and a longtime media
investor. 

But Haverty, like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry
analysts, hardly cares. With the merger likely to be completed later
this month, he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by
combining AOL's marketing skills and captive base of online users
with Time Warner's huge library of films, magazines and the like and
its relationships with major advertisers. 

``The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the
world,'' Haverty said. ``Five years out, if you're a shareholder in
this company, you're going to be a happy camper.'' 

That view is widely shared. ``Strategically, it makes a lot of
sense,'' said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein. ``These companies
fill the holes of the other one. They're subscription-advertising
combo models. The reality is the pieces are very compatible.'' 

To be sure, the recent history of big media mergers is hardly
comforting for shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner. Disney
stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, and Time
Warner stagnated for five years after it was created in 1990 by the
merger of Time and Warner. ``Huge deals are really hard to do and
create a lot of uncertainty,'' said Roger McNamee of Integral
Capital, which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was
announced. 

But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle, it will have big
advantages over Disney and other traditional media companies, which
are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the
Internet, said Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch. 

``Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have, it's
obviously a very powerful consumer engine,'' Reif said. ``There's a
reason that you see Disney and to a lesser extent NBC screaming in
Washington.'' 

John Schreiber, an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital, the
mutual fund company that is Time Warner's largest shareholder, with
more than 120 million shares, said the companies had already begun
to demonstrate how they would work together. For example, AOL has
pitched Time Warner's magazines to its users, resulting in hundreds
of thousands of new subscriptions. And the companies are trying to
sell big advertisers on deals that will reach both America Online
users and the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read
its magazines, Schreiber said. 

``Once the merger closes, I think you'll see some very powerful
cross-promotional deals across all of Time Warner's advertisers,''
he said. 

Schreiber also says the risk of cultural clashes between the
companies is limited, because the companies disclosed publicly where
top executives would stand in the combined company only a few weeks
after the merger was announced. So people who feel their
responsibilities have been diminished have had months to look for
new jobs, and some have already left, he said. 

Given the strength he sees in the combined company, Schreiber said
the question of whether Levin could have negotiated a better deal
with America Online is moot. Shares in cable companies like Comcast
have fallen 15 percent or more this year, while big media companies
have been flat or up slightly. So ``it's not as if Time Warner
shareholders have lost out on a great deal of upside,'' Schreiber
said.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto
disobeyed a summons to surrender himself to prosecutors Monday and
be imprisoned for corruption. 

Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, 37, was sentenced to 18 months in
prison on Sept. 22 by the Supreme Court, which overturned an earlier
acquittal by a lower court. 

It found him guilty of enriching himself through a property deal
with the state's main food supply agency. Prosecutors said the 1997
deal, made when his father was still in power, had cost the
Indonesian state $10.8 million. 

Tommy, a multimillionaire with a playboy image and love of fast
cars, is the first member of Suharto's family to be convicted of
graft. 

Because the Supreme Court's decision to imprison Tommy did not come
into immediate effect, prosecutors served a summons on Tommy to be
taken into custody Monday. He instead sent a legal team to discuss
whether he would appeal the ruling or admit his guilt and seek a
presidential pardon. 

The delay of Tommy's arrest comes just days after another court
dismissed other corruption charges against his 79-year-old father on
grounds of ill health, enraging pro-democracy activists and
triggering violent demonstrations. 

Critics of Indonesia's legal system have accused it of going soft on
the Suharto clan. 

A co-defendant in Tommy's case, businessman Riccardo Gelael,
separately admitted his guilt Monday to prosecutors and said he
would appeal to President Abdurrahman Wahid for a pardon. 

Antasari Ashar, chief of South Jakarta Prosecution Office, said
Tommy would again be summoned to meet prosecutors on Wednesday. 

If Tommy opts for a judicial review of the case, his fate will be
decided by the same court that last week dismissed graft charges
against his father. 

The decision to let Suharto off triggered fierce street
demonstrations, in which one man died and dozens were injured. 

For weeks Suharto's trial had been marred by a series of bombings in
Jakarta, including a blast at the city's stock exchange building in
which 15 people were killed. 

Many suspect supporters of Suharto, who ruled for 32 years until his
ouster in 1998, were behind the attacks.

Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now. I'm Erin Brumett in
Washington. The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is
in the state courts and heading for the US Supreme Court at the end
of the week. That's virtually unprecedented, as the Federal Courts
have tended to stay out of elections, which are the responsibility
of the states. Joe O'Grossman is a professor of constitutional law
at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University. He says that in this
instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such
that they had no real alternative but to take the case. 
<TURN>
Well, I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such
a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try
to reject it out of hand. In fact, I think that Lawrence Tribe, the
Harvard Law School Professor who is arguing for Gore tomorrow, is
going to ask the court to hold the case, moot and dismiss it. And
the Bush campaign has brought the case, but recognizes that the
particular issues that they brought to the court last week are
really not very relevant anymore. They are going to probably, well,
I know what they are going to do. They are going to try to broaden
the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election
procedures. So, they are looking for a coronation. And the Gore
people at this point just want to get rid of this case, because they
think they have a better chance in the Florida courts. 
<TURN>
Republicans generally support states' rights. So, does it appear
somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this
instance? 
<TURN>
No, I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states'
rights and Democrats oppose it, is much too simplistic. That's
generally true, but it's only true on some issues. And in this case,
you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court
to preserve the right of Florida, to determine its own electors. So,
there is a kind of states' rights issue there. But they need, or at
least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it.
So it goes both ways. 
<TURN>
What are the justices likely looking for? 
<TURN>
Well, I don't know. But I think that - and I think they will be
divided, I mean I don't think they will be unanimous. Obviously,
they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the
case. American election laws are often challenged at the local level
and sometimes in the Federal courts, but this is certainly the first
time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential
election. So, there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least
law that hasn't been made yet. It's possible that if the court
accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign, at least as it is
expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday, that the court
will in the sense, take the entire issue, even - not just the
specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve
the question. For example, if the court says it is clearly the fact
that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for
itself who its electors will be, that will pretty much end the case,
because that's what the legislature already plans to do. And that
doesn't mean the Gore people won't keep trying, because ultimately
Congress has to decide and only Congress can decide if there are
competing slates of electors submitted, which slate to accept. 
<TURN>
The Johns Hopkins University constitutional law professor Joe
O'Grossman says, it's still not certain the Supreme Court will
actually hear the Florida case. As their first order, business
Friday, attorneys for Vice President Gore will move to have the
court dismiss the case brought by Republican George W Bush.

WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) _ Republican Rep. J.C. Watts joked
Saturday night that he had revised returns on the presidential
election: ``Al Gore, 9,834 lawsuits. George W. Bush, 7,652.'' 

Watts, chairman of the House Republican Conference, bantered about
the Florida election dispute in a speech prepared for a dinner of
The Gridiron Club at the Greenbrier Hotel. 

``I knew things had really deteriorated when Yasser Arafat offered
to broker a peace between Bush and Gore,'' Watts said. 

The Gridiron Club is an organization of 60 Washington journalists.
Its dinners feature parodies of politics and government, and
humorous speeches by political figures. 

Watts noted that the presidential election of 1876 was so disputed
that a congressional commission was created to settle it. ``I didn't
know this until Strom Thurmond told me he cast the deciding vote. 

``Strom will be 98 next Tuesday,'' Watts said. ``Of course, he was
only 67 when the recount of Florida ballots began.'' 

Watts said he had fond memories of Florida because he was the
quarterback when the University of Oklahoma won the Orange Bowl
there in 1980 and 1981. ``But our victory in '81 was by a single
point and it was weeks before it was confirmed,'' he said. ``By the
way, I recently learned Al Gore was pulling for Florida State and
demanded a recount.'' 

As is traditional in Gridiron speeches, Watts concluded on a serious
note. ``Once-in-a-century oddities may leave an election result up
in the air for a time, but the fundamental strength of our democracy
is never in doubt,'' he said. 

``Better a process driven by an army of lawyers than an outrage led
by an army with guns,'' he said.

LONDON (AP) _ After three defeats in the House of Lords, Britain's
Labor government resorted to rarely used powers Thursday to pass
legislation lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to
16. 

House of Commons speaker Michael Martin said he was invoking the
Parliament Act to force through a Sexual Offenses Bill that makes
the age of consent the same for both homosexuals and heterosexuals.
It became law after being given Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II. 

Lawmakers in the House of Commons overwhelmingly approved the bill
earlier this year, but the House of Lords this month rejected it for
the third time. 

The Lords' powers, however, are limited to delaying legislation by
blocking it and bouncing it back to the House of Commons. The
Parliament Act was created to ensure that the will of the country's
elected lawmakers prevails. 

The bill brings Britain in line with most other European Union
nations. 

``It is a reform which, in my personal view, is long overdue and is
only right for a country that has a history of reform and
challenging prejudice,'' said Home Secretary Jack Straw, Britain's
top law enforcement officer. 

``This act will help us to build a safe, just and tolerant
society,'' he added. 

Angela Mason, director of the gay rights group Stonewall, said
Parliament's action was ``a great step toward equality.'' 

``When the history books come to be written I believe it will be
seen as the moment when this country finally began to change, when
lesbians and gay men started to take our place as equal members of
society,'' she said. 

Peter Tatchell, of the group OutRage!, said: ``This victory is a
welcome and historic milestone in the long struggle for gay human
rights.'' 

``My only regret is that it has taken 33 years during which time
hundreds of gay men have been unjustly jailed for victimless
relationships.'' 

However, family values campaigner and Conservative ex-Leader of the
Lords Baroness Young accused the government of behaving in a
``completely dictatorial manner'' toward Parliament. 

Straw dismissed the criticism. ``In the circumstances I believe that
the use of the Parliament Act in this case is proper and
justified,'' he said. 

Five years ago, Parliament narrowly rejected lowering the age of
consent for homosexuals to 16, reducing it instead from 21 to 18.
Homosexual sex between adults ceased to be a crime in Britain three
decades ago.

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In his foreign policy debut as Syria's
president, Bashar Assad met Sunday with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in talks on Mideast peace and the escalating violence in the
Palestinian territories. 

Assad, on his first trip abroad since becoming president in July,
also dealt with the issue of Iraq in the talks with Mubarak,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said. 

The Syrian leader's visit came on a fourth day of clashes that have
raged in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem, leaving more than
two dozen Palestinians dead. 

``There is complete agreement (between Mubarak and Assad) as to the
seriousness of the situation and that the negative repercussions
would adversely effect the peace process, which is in itself in a
very precarious state,'' Moussa said. 

Assad, 35, has focused on domestic issues since his father, Hafez
Assad, died in June after 30 years in power. He has taken steps to
modernize his nation's bureaucracy and revive its stagnant economy. 

``This was the first meeting of the first visit of President Bashar
Assad after the funeral of his father, so it was only normal for the
discussions to have a general tone ... in addition to certain
specifics of special importance to both countries and the Arab
world,'' Moussa said. 

The late Syrian president rarely traveled abroad. In his last few
years, however, he had sent Bashar, educated as an eye doctor, on
foreign trips as part of his grooming to become president. 

Prospects appear dim for progress on either the Syrian or
Palestinian peace track. The deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli talks
is exacerbated by the worst violence in four years. Syria's
government-run media said last week that no progress could be
expected now because of the U.S. elections and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's precarious situation as leader of a minority
government. 

Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations broke down in January, with Syria
demanding a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau captured by Israel in 1967. Israel insists on waiting to
settle borders until it knows what it will gain by returning Golan
land. 

Assad has made it clear he intends to follow his father's course in
any negotiations with Israel. 

Mubarak and Assad met after a week when Russia, France, Jordan and
Yemen sent planes to Baghdad, challenging U.N. sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq is hoping other Arab
countries will follow, despite U.S. complaints, easing its
isolation. 

Moussa said the presidents discussed the situation in Iraq and would
return to it Monday. However, he would not comment on whether Syria
and Egypt were planning to send planes to Baghdad. 

Egypt and Syria are on good terms, but they have had their
differences. Hafez Assad's attempts to rally Arab leaders to present
a unified front against Israel gained little ground. He derided
Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.

COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) _ Joseph Conrad Parkhurst, who founded the
motorcycle magazine Cycle World in 1962, has died. He was 74. 

Parkhurst had lung cancer and died Tuesday as a result of a blood
clot in his lung, his wife Claire Parkhurst told the Los Angeles
Times for Sunday editions. 

Cycle World brought objective journalism to motorcycle periodicals
by offering road tests and a more critical eye than other
fan-oriented magazines, said analyst Don Brown of DJB Associates LLC
of Irvine. 

In its first year, Cycle World became _ and remains _ the largest
motorcycle magazine in the world, Brown and others said. It boasts a
monthly circulation of 315,000 and its closest rival is the German
magazine Das Motorrad. 

``Joe was a true pioneer in our business,'' said current Cycle World
publisher Larry Little. ``It was kind of a breaking of a good old
boy network of American motorcycles. Joe did not shun the Japanese
makers.'' 

Born in Jonesboro, Ark., on Oct. 20, 1926, Parkhurst moved with his
family to California. He served in 1954-56 as a clerk in an Army
Reserves office, then took a job as art director of Road & Track
magazine in Newport Beach. 

He later quit to spend a year traveling in Europe and returned to
become art director of Carting World, a go-cart magazine, in 1960.
While working, Parkhurst began dreaming of Cycle World. 

He thought that Road & Track's consumer approach could serve
motorcyclists, said Joe Rusz, a senior editor at Road & Track.
Parkhurst also loved riding motorcycles and once told a friend that
he ``could never find something worthwhile to read about them,''
Little said. 

Parkhurst later merged with another company that owned Road & Track
to become Bond/Parkhurst Publishing. He sold both magazines in the
early 1970s, said his wife of 22 years. Since 1979, he has written
and published the Motorcycle Business Newsletter, a biweekly for
industry insiders. 

In addition to his wife, Parkhurst is survived by a brother, John
Parkhurst of Hemet. A memorial is planned for January.

Documented. From NPR news in Washington, I'm Corey Flintoff. A
Florida State judge has ordered local election officials to ship
thousands of ballots to the state capital. The move comes as the
judge decides whether to order a recount of those ballots in the
presidential election. NPR's Steve Inski was in the courtroom.
Steve, what are the issues that came up in this hearing tonight? 
<TURN>
Corey judge N. Sander Sauls is deciding whether to order a recount
as you said of those ballots, 9000 or more actually from Miami Dade
County that apparently were never counted at all, at least according
to the Democrats in the presidential election and about 3300 ballots
from Palm Beach County that were considered by local officials but
then thrown out, disallowed. Judge Sauls is deciding whether to
count those ballots and go through them and perhaps add some votes
to Al Gore's final total, which is exactly what the Democrats want.
He is not ready to do that yet. He did not agree to the Democratic
proposal to begin counting tomorrow morning but he has ordered that
the ballots be shipped up. Later this week, Miami Police apparently
are going to escort them upto Tallahassee and they will be ready to
be counted if the judge decides at a later time to do so. 
<TURN>
Now time is a big consideration from here. What's the judge's
timetable? 
<TURN>
Not as fast as the Democrats would like, not as slowly as
Republicans would prefer. He is going to order a major hearing on
Saturday to review all the legal and evidentiary issues, look at
evidence, perhaps hear from witnesses and after that the judge will
decide if there are any ballots to count. It might take another five
days or so to do it. Neither side seemed particularly pleased by the
timetable but the judge said, well, I am going to make everybody
equally unhappy. 
<TURN>
Thank you. NPR's Steven Inksi reporting from Tallahassee, Florida.
As the battle over votes goes on in Florida, Washington State is in
the middle of recounting the votes cast in its very tight US Senate
race. Jennifer Nesan reports from member station KPLU in Seattle. 
<TURN>
The recount of the votes cast for Democrat Maria Catwell and
Republican Senator Slate Gordon is calm and organized. The State's
Elections Director Garry Macintosh says the process is about as
exciting as watching paint dry. 
<TURN>
There are a lot of things about the election's process I think that
are fairly complex. This isn't probably one of them. 
<TURN>
Catwell leads Republican incumbent Slate Gordon by fewer then 2000
votes. At this point neither of the candidates plan to contest any
of the votes. State law requires a recount when the margin of
victory is less than one half of 1 percent. The recount is expected
to be completed by the end of the week. No statewide recount in
Washington has ever changed the initial outcome. For NPR news, I'm

Baghdad 11-15 (AFP) -

The head of the French Interests Section in Baghdad, Ambassador Andre
Janier, today Wednesday welcomed Iraq's decision to deal in euros and
said this would encourage relations between the two countries.


In an interview in today's edition of the official newspaper
"al-Jamhouriya," Janier said "we French believe this decision is
positive for the international economy, and this decision encourages
economic relations, especially in terms of oil, between Iraq and
France."


The French diplomat carried on to say "we have a vested interest in
this matter as Europeans and French because all trade payments and
exchanges are paid in euros and there is no danger to European and
French companies because of fluctuations in the price of the dollar
on the stock exchange. This compensates for any loss in buying and
selling in euros rather than dollars."


Iraq decided to deal in euros, rather than the dollar, as of the
sixth of this month for its oil sales and outside trade deals.

DENVER (AP) _ The Denver Broncos and the NFL want a commercial real
estate agent to take down a sign advertising a site for a potential
sports bar because it features the team's name. 

John ``Jack'' Hanlon of Coldwell Banker American Spectrum is listing
an acre of land about a mile from the Broncos' training camp in Dove
Valley. 

Hanlon, a longtime Broncos fan, thinks it is the perfect place for a
sports bar and has put up a blue-and-orange sign reading, ``Wanted
Broncos Sports Bar On This Site.'' 

He said that 47,000 cars drive by the site daily and ``because the
players have to drive by it every day it could become a hangout for
them.'' 

Hanlon said he never has implied that the future sports bar would be
called the Broncos Bar, but his company has turned over the matter
to its legal department. 

``I thought it would be a good idea to have a bar that would
celebrate the Broncos, emphasizing everything Broncos with pregame
and postgame activities,'' Hanlon said. ``But I couldn't put that on
a 4-by-8 sign.'' 

He said he will do whatever his lawyer advises, but ``I don't think
the Broncos own the word 'Broncos.''' 

NFL lawyer David Proper has given Hanlon until Dec. 26 to remove the
sign. 

In a Nov. 28 letter, Proper states ``while we have no objection to
your advertising the property as a location for a sports bar, using
the Broncos' name and colors gives the false impression that the bar
is or can be affiliated with the Broncos.'' 

The land is valued at $650,000 and the bar could cost about $1
million to $1.2 million, Hanlon said.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban militia on Monday
released 137 Shiite Muslim prisoners it had held for nearly two
years and urged the opposition to follow suit and release government
prisoners it is holding. 

The freed men, all said to be fighters belonging to the opposition
alliance, were released ahead of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan,
when devout Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. 

``The prisoners are being released as a gesture of kindness'' by the
Taliban's supreme leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, said the Taliban's
Interior Minister Abdul Razzak Akhund. ``We ask the opposition to
show their heart and release government prisoners in their jails.'' 

The opposition alliance, which controls barely five percent of
Afghanistan and is fighting a war against the dominant Taliban, is
mostly made up of the country's minority ethnic and religious
groups. 

The Taliban are predominantly Sunni Muslim, which is the majority
Islamic sect in the country. 

The Taliban have been accused by international human rights groups
of mistreating the minority Shiite Muslims, a charge they reject. 

The newly released prisoners were captured when the Taliban took
control of Afghanistan's central Bamyan province, nearly two years
ago. The area is largely inhabited by minority Shiite Muslims. 

``I am very happy to be going home,'' said Ali Jan, one of the
prisoners who said he was a farmer in Bamyan and not a soldier.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ One of baseball's biggest free-agent prizes,
Alex Rodriguez is getting red-carpet treatment from the Texas
Rangers. 

And even the Dallas Stars are lending a hand in trying to win over
the All-Star shortstop. 

Rodriguez and agent Scott Boras were expected to meet Monday with
Rangers owner Tom Hicks. He will be joined by general manager Doug
Melvin, manager Johnny Oates and several players. 

The team's bid for Rodriguez hasn't been slowed by the expected
demand of at least a 10-year contract, in the range of $20 million a
year, loaded with fringe benefits. 

``We feel at the expense of last year, we have our roster where we
don't have to trade people to make this work,'' Melvin said in the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Monday. ``I'm not saying we have all the
money in the world, but we don't have to bust our budget completely.
We're in a better position than most other clubs.'' 

Stars center Mike Modano is being called in to help show Rodriguez
around the Dallas-Fort Worth area and tell him why it would be a
great place to play. 

Melvin said he doesn't expect the Rangers to make a formal offer
until they can gauge the level of interest from Rodriguez. 

The 25-year-old shortstop, who hit .316 with 41 homers and 132 RBIs
at Seattle last season, also reportedly has been targeted by the
Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets and Atlanta
Braves. 

The Mariners, Rodriguez's team the past six years, also wanted to
re-sign him. 

``This gives us a chance to tell him about our organization and the
direction we're going, answer any questions they might have about
us,'' Melvin said. 

Some even have a neighborhood _ the fashionable Dallas suburb of
Highland Park _ picked out for Rodriguez. Neighbors of one available
residence _ a five-bedroom spread worth $11.95 million _ would
include Hicks, Modano and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. 

``Alex needs to buy this house,'' Ronda Needham, a listing agent,
told The Dallas Morning News. ``The people who own this house set it
up around their two baseball-playing sons. It's a very sports-minded
house.'' 

The Mets, once considered the favorites to get Rodriguez, have
slowed their chase. General manager Steve Phillips publicly
criticized some of the demands supposedly made by Boras. But the
agent says Rodriguez is making no special demands. 

``I can't anticipate any change that would draw us back into it,''
Phillips said.

Beirut 8-15 (AFP) -

Lebanon has asked the international peacekeeping force operating in
the south to investigate reports indicating that Israel is
penetrating the shared border between the two countries and to
prevent this from happening.


According to official sources, the Lebanese authorities contacted the
peacekeeping high command and asked it to put an end to infringements
by Israel, which is carrying out operations inside Lebanese
territory, in particular dumping sand and building slopes.


The source added that if this is confirmed, then such acts constitute
a provocation and an infringement of Lebanese sovereignty.


Witnesses said two Israeli bulldozers started work today Tuesday on a
slope in the Abbad sector inside Lebanese territory on the border
between Lebanon and Israel.


These witnesses told Agence France Presse that an Israeli army patrol
equipped with ultra-modern binoculars penetrated a few meters into
Lebanese territory but withdrew back to Israeli territory as soon as
a peacekeeping patrol arrived.


Families in southern Lebanon visit this area where, according to
tradition, the burial site of Sheikh Abbad, who died 500 years ago,
is located.

For their part, Israelis also regard the site as a shrine because,
according to them, Rabbi Ashi lived there in the 5th century.


The Israeli army had previously carried out operations inside
Lebanese territory in the same border region on August 11.


Last Friday, an Israeli bulldozer crossed the wire fence in Wadi
Marjayoun near the Israeli village of Matla and spread sand over a
length of hundreds of meters and a width of six meters in order to
expose the footprints of people crossing the border or tire prints of
cars from the Lebanese side.

MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved
the Soviet anthem as Russia's national hymn _ a move praised by some
as a gesture of reconciliation and denounced by others as a symbolic
approval of the nation's totalitarian past. 

The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 381-51 to
approve the bill, which was strongly backed by President Vladimir
Putin. The move restored the old anthem's music by composer
Alexander Alexandrov but not the original text that included praise
for Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin. 

By the same strong majority, the Duma approved legislation formally
endorsing the country's current white-red-and-blue flag as Russia's
official flag. That legislation also brings back the Soviet-era red
banner as the military's flag and retains the Czarist double-headed
eagle as the state emblem. 

Putin has said the mixture of old Russian and Soviet symbols would
mend bitter rifts in society by paying tribute to the positive
heritage of both periods. He referred to opinion polls showing that
most people prefer Alexandrov's music to a melody by 19th-century
composer Mikhail Glinka, which has been Russia's anthem since the
1991 Soviet collapse. 

Liberal politicians and many leading cultural figures have strongly
opposed the reinstatement of the Soviet anthem, saying it symbolized
political repression. 

``We strongly protest against the Stalinist anthem, which is stained
by the blood of millions of victims,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the
head of the liberal Yabloko faction. 

Yabloko and another liberal faction, the Union of Right Forces, said
they might appeal Friday's vote in the Constitutional Court. The
Duma usually hears speeches by faction leaders before a vote, but
this time lawmakers skipped the debate _ a move the liberals
described as a procedural violation. 

``For the first time, the opposition was refused the right to speak
out,'' Yavlinsky said. ``The presidential administration and
Communists were afraid of our arguments against the Soviet anthem.'' 

Former President Boris Yeltsin has joined other critics of the move
to restore the anthem. He said in an interview published Friday in
the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that the solemn music recalls
Communist Party congresses, not Soviet sports victories and
achievements in space, as Putin had said. 

``I'm categorically against the restoration of the Soviet anthem,''
Yeltsin said. 

Communists and other hard-liners had opposed the tricolor flag and
the eagle as a vestige of the Czars, forcing Yeltsin to approve them
by decree. But they agreed to abandon their criticism and back
formal approval for the symbols in response to the reintroduction of
the Soviet anthem. 

No conclusive version of new lyrics for the old music has been
approved yet. The Duma asked Putin to set up a panel to consider the
text and submit the final version for its approval. 

During Friday's debate, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said
officials had received an anonymous telephone call saying a bomb had
been planted in the building. Lawmakers ignored it and continued
their session as police officers with sniffer dogs searched the
premises.

Jerusalem 7-15 (AFP) -

A high level Israeli army official has said today Saturday that
Israel believes Iran is set to begin acquiring nuclear capability for
military purposes from 2005 and will be in a position to equip
missiles with nuclear warheads, capable of reaching Israel, within
ten years.


The official, who wished to remain anonymous, told journalists: "Iran
will start accumulating nuclear capability for military purposes from
2005 and will be in a position, within the space of 10 years, to
produce nuclear warheads that can be fitted to missiles capable of
striking Israel."


The official made these statements after Tehran announced today
Saturday that it had "successfully" completed a new test on the
Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a range of 1300 kilometers.


The official further said: "Iran is not capable of developing a
nuclear program without Moscow's help."


He said that according to information obtained by Israel, tests on
the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile were in fact "successful and
reached their maximum range of 1300 kilometers which allows them to
reach strategic centers in Israel."


The official said that the design of the Shahab missile is based on a
North Korean missile called Nodong, itself developed from the Soviet
Scud missile.


The official also stressed that Iran regards the "destruction of
Israel as legitimate," saying that "Tehran is embroiled in strategic
terrorist activities targeting Israel, especially alongside
Palestinian and Lebanese organizations."


The official further considered that "the Shahab missile will not
come into operation for two years and that an improved range of 2000
kilometers would only be achieved after this period."


Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, said today Saturday
that Israel would "know how to find a suitable response" to the
Iranian Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a 1300 kilometer range.


Sneh said on army radio that "Israel will prepare itself to find a
suitable response to this threat," without giving any further
details.


The Iranian army announced today Saturday that it had "successfully"
completed a new test on Shahab 3 ground-ground missiles.


An official at the Iranian Ministry of Defense told Tehran Radio that
the "Shahab 3 defense missile was tested a second time to ensure it
conforms to international standards."


In July 1998, the first test on this missile was announced. It is
capable of reaching the majority of countries in the region,
including Israel.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) _ Tornadoes destroyed homes and overturned
cars in several areas of Alabama on Saturday and more than two dozen
people were reported injured. 

At least one person was killed in Tuscaloosa, said Debbie Watson,
spokeswoman for the Tuscaloosa County Emergency Management Agency. 

Twisters struck just before noon in the state's rural southeastern
corner, then hit Tuscaloosa and the northern part of the state as
lines of thunderstorms swept across the South. 

The Tuscaloosa twister struck a subdivision, Watson said. The
National Weather Service said there was extensive damage. Twenty-one
people were injured, according to broadcast reports. 

Another tornado hit Geneva, near the Alabama-Florida line, said
Mayor Warren Beck. He said vehicles were overturned and homes were
destroyed. 

Geneva County Emergency Management Agency director Margaret Mixon
said eight people were injured, two of them severely. 

That tornado also damaged about a half-dozen homes in Dale County,
destroying a peanut mill at Abbeville and damaging a textile mill,
authorities said. 

Dale County Commissioner Buddy Stapleton said he counted about a
half-dozen homes hit near Newton. 

In northern Alabama, about eight homes were reported destroyed and
trees and power lines were toppled in Limestone County.

Jerusalem 11-15 (AFP) -

Official Israeli radio reported that the lesser security cabinet
which met this evening Wednesday has made a series of practical
decisions pointing to its desire to avoid confrontations with the
Palestinians.


The radio reported "senior political officials" as saying at the
close of the security cabinet's meeting, chaired by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, that the army would continue with the procedure it has
followed over the past days and that there would be no escalation.


Military officials who also attended the meeting that Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat "wants to drag Israel into an escalation
which would lead to international intervention."


The head of the prime minister's office, Jalaad Shir, had previously
said on official television that "a compromise must be found between
a studied response not leading to escalation and the need to pave the
way for political openness, on the condition that the Palestinians
resolutely stop the violence and incitement to violence."


Shir added "only then will it be possible to think about resuming the
political process and on what basis."


The security cabinet was convened to a session with the aim of
examining new measures to deal with the escalation in attacks against
Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.


Last week, Barak gave his consent, for the first time since the
Intifada began, to elimination of Hussein Abiyat the military leader
of Fatah movement led by Arafat killed when a missile fired from a
combat helicopter targeted his car.


Israeli security forces arrested 15 Fatah officials in the West Bank
on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday.


In his statement, Barak praised this operation and the elimination of
Abiyat, stressing that this policy would continue.

He said "the long arm of our forces will reach those who attack our
civilians and soldiers."

Recently, HSBC has moved its Shanghai branch to the China Shipping
Mansion in the Pudong Lujiazui financial trading district, becoming
the third foreign capital bank to be approved to operate RMB business
and shift to Pudong.


At the moment, Shanghai already has 8 foreign capital banks approved
to operate RMB business. They are the US's Citibank, Hong Kong's
HSBC, Japan's Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank, Japan's Industrial Bank, the
Shanghai Branch of the Standard and Chartered Bank, Shanghai's BNP
Paris Bank, the Shanghai Branch of Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and
the Shanghai Branch of Japan's Sanwa Bank.

According to regulations, these 8 banks will all move to Pudong soon.


After the policy was formally announced for the Pudong Lujiazui
Financial Trade District to allow foreign capital banks to operate
RMB business, more than 40 foreign capital banks and financial
institutions have submitted applications to establish branches in
Pudong.


When selecting locations in Lujiazui, some foreign financial
institutions do not mind the real estate prices, but focus more on
whether the class of the building is compatible with the standing of
the company.

The Franklin Templeton Company, whose headquarters are in California,
the US, and has registered capital of 130 billion US dollars all
around the world, decided to establish its local China headquarters
in Pudong.

The president of the company and the Asian regional president
personally surveyed Pudong and decided to choose office locations in
the Shanghai Securities Building, which has a floor rate of more than
2700 US dollars per square meter.

Now, the Templeton Company has formally signed a contract, and bought
the floor area of the entire 18th floor of the Securities Building.


Currently, foreign-capital banks and financial institutions such as
Hong Kong's HSBC, the Shanghai Branch of the Japan Industrial Bank,
the Holland Co-operation Bank, Shanghai Branch of the Belgium Credit
Bank, etc., have successively settled down in the Lujiazui Financial
Trading District.

Soon, a large number of domestic and foreign financial institutions,
and large companies will also come to successively settle down,
including the finance street which has already formed in the Waitan
district, and the Shanghai central commercial district framework that
is forming.

Camp Zeist (Holland) 11-15 (AFP) -

Today Wednesday, the judges in charge of looking into the Lockerbie
case in Camp Zeist (Holland) were faced with an awkward problem: how
to deal with a witness who is refusing to answer questions and who is
at the same time serving a life sentence and who is not subject to
Scottish law?


The problem arose after Palestinian Mahmood Abu Talib, whose
testimony the court has been hearing since Friday, refused to
continue answering a question by defense lawyer Richard Keen about
the detailed reasons for his having lived in the former Soviet Union
for a period of 18 months in the 70s.


The lawyer asked the judges to force Abu Talib to answer the question
aimed at demonstrating the witness's "professional terrorism"
precedents.


46-year-old Abu Talib was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1990 in
Sweden for terrorist acts in Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm
between 1985 and 1986. The defense council in the Lockerbie court is
attempting to show his involvement in the Lockerbie attack.


Based on Scottish law, followed in this court, if Abu Talib insists
on not responding to the question, this is considered to be "contempt
of court" and means he may be punished in accordance with Scottish
law covering such incidents.


The problem is that the judges may not punish Abu Talib unless Sweden
hands him over to Scotland after the court case ends to apply the
punishment for "contempt of court."


So far, the judges have not asked Abu Talib to answer the defense's
question in what appears to be a move to avoid a tricky situation if
the witness refuses to answer.


The court president, Ronald Sutherland, who adjourned the session for
a short while in an attempt to find a solution to this dilemma, said
"this raises an important question of principle."


The two Libyans, Alameen Khalifa Fahima and Abdulbasit al-Maqrahi,
are suspected of sending a bomb from Malta which was used to explode
the Pan Am plane over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on December
21, 1988 killing 270 people.

PHOENIX (AP) _ Boise State coach Dirk Koetter, who just a day
earlier was reportedly headed for Oklahoma State, has agreed to a
contract to coach Arizona State. 

Oklahoma State athletic director Terry Don Phillips confirmed
Koetter's decision in a news release issued Friday night. 

``Coach Koetter informed me at approximately 7 p.m. (CST) tonight
that he had been tendered an offer from Arizona State University and
had accepted,'' Phillips said. 

Koetter, 41, replaces Bruce Snyder, who was fired after nine
seasons. Snyder will coach Arizona State in a bowl game, most likely
the Las Vegas Bowl. 

The Daily Oklahoman and several TV and radio stations in Oklahoma
had reported Thursday and Friday that Koetter had accepted the
Oklahoma State job. 

But Phillips never confirmed those reports, and Koetter would not
comment on any job possibilities at Boise State's practice Friday.
Koetter said earlier in the week he had interviewed with Phillips
and with Arizona State athletic director Gene Smith. 

Koetter is considered one of the country's top young coaching
prospects. Using an innovative, wide-open offense, he guided Boise
State to a 25-10 record in three seasons. His first team went 6-5,
followed by last year's 10-3 record, which included a 34-31 victory
over Louisville in the Humanitarian Bowl. 

This year's team is 9-2, with its only losses 38-31 at Arkansas and
42-25 at Washington State. 

Koetter may not have been Arizona State's top choice. 

Phoenix radio station KMVP reported Friday that Smith had quietly
been working on a deal with TCU coach Dennis Franchione that would
have matched the one offered by Alabama. But Franchione apparently
couldn't resist the lure of one of college football's most storied
programs. 

While most of the recent speculation centered on Koetter, there was
pressure from some Arizona State boosters to hire Danny White, the
former Arizona State and Dallas Cowboys quarterback who coaches the
Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League. 

Snyder was fired after his teams went 6-6 last year and 6-5 this
season.

Eyewitnesses said the clashes broke out when the Israeli army began
bulldozing Palestinian land near the border with Egypt and opened
fire randomly on Palestinian citizens when they threw stones at the
soldiers in protest. An Israeli tank also fired a rocket.


Elsewhere, Israeli bulldozers dug up dozens of hectares of
Palestinian farmland near the village of Alkarara (near the Kosovim
checkpoint) last night for the second day in a row, destroying two
houses and a well, where the army erected a new military camp
instead.


The town's authorities said last night the Israeli army dug up
several hectares planted with orange trees in southern Gaza
(Nitsarim).


The bulldozing of land began the night before last when an Israeli
soldier was killed in a shooting incident in the area.

Washington 11-15 (AFP) -

Stewart Talbot, America's Assistant Secretary of State and "second in
charge" at the State Department after Madeleine Albright, has decided
to resign from the administration to head one of the departments at
Yale University in the state of Connecticut (northeast).


Richard Levin, the Chancellor of this prestigious university, said
Talbot would head the Globalization Studies Center as of next July
and would also teach at the university.


Talbot is the second top-ranking American diplomat in a few days to
announce his intention of resigning at the end of President Bill
Clinton's second term next January 20.


The special envoy to the Middle East, Dennis Ross, announced last
week that he intends to resign from his post, for personal and family
reasons, once the current administration's term comes to an end.


Talbot, a Yale graduate and former correspondent with Time magazine,
was appointed assistant to the Secretary of State in 1994 after
acting as roving ambassador and special advisor on former Soviet
Union Affairs.

completing its troop withdrawal from the three Baltic Sea countries.

Russian troops stationed in Lithuania had withdrawn to Russia one
year earlier.

On August 31st of this year, Russian troops stationed in Latvia
withdrew completely and Russian troops stationed in Estonia also
completed withdrawal on August 29th of this year.


In an interview with International Correspondence Communication News
Agency on the 31st, Klelov, vice-minister of Russia's Foreign
Affairs, pointed out that, although Russia has withdrawn its troops
from the Baltic Sea countries, if the Baltic Sea countries infringe
upon the rights of local Russian-speaking residents, the Russian
government still has measures for exerting influence over these
countries, which include political, economical and humanitarian
measures.

Bandar Seri Begawan 11-15 (AFP) -

A high-level American official announced today Wednesday in the wake
of the meeting between American President Bill Clinton and his
Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Putin's proposals on reducing
the Russian and American nuclear capability to under 1500 nuclear
heads does not include "many new elements."


The official who wished to remain anonymous confirmed "we have paid a
great deal of attention to President Putin's announcement but it does
not contain many new elements, in fact just a few new disparities
which require further examination and discussion by experts."


Clinton and Putin are taking part in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bandar Seri Begawan the capital of the
Sultanate of Brunei.

The presidents met for a working lunch of around 75 minutes.


The American official stressed that what is important in Putin's
proposal is that it falls within the "framework adopted by the United
States and Russia to discuss strategic issues from a defensive and
offensive point of view."


Putin proposed limiting the Russian and American nuclear capabilities
by reducing the number of nuclear heads to under 1500 each, a smaller
number than that in the Russian-American Start-3 treaty currently
being negotiated.

He proposed that the current reduction should be between 2500 to 2000
nuclear heads.


Putin said this reduction would depend on compliance with the
Russian-American anti-ABM missile treaty signed in 1972, which the
Americans are attempting to amend to set up anti- missile defenses
(NMD).


Washington has so far confirmed agreeing to the 2000 to 2500 nuclear
warhead ceiling.

The United States has not taken a final position on the NMD system
because Clinton, whose term ends in January, is leaving the decision
in this matter to his successor.


In response to a question about Republican presidential candidate
George Bush Junior's approach to deploying the NMD system, more
ambitious than the one proposed by the Clinton administration, the
American official said the United States would continue "complying
with the present framework" in these strategic discussions.


He added "while this framework does not reflect the basic interests
of the United States, we feel it is still a valid approach in our
discussions with Russia on this matter."


He also said that Clinton raised the issue of the transfer of
sensitive Russian technology to Iran, adding "President Putin has
expressed his agreement that these are real threats and is strongly
committed to limiting this, but there is still a lot of work to do"
in this area.


Clinton also touched on the matter of American Edmond Bob who is
being tried in a closed court in Russia on charges of spying. The
United States believes he is innocent of these charges and is
demanding his release on humanitarian grounds.


The official said Putin understands our concern and we hope he will
do something as quickly as possible."

It's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing and
the media. 

_ Will Americans ever refer to the day before Thanksgiving as
``Thanksgiving Wednesday,'' as ABC did repeatedly this week in
commercials promoting its Wednesday sitcoms ``The Drew Carey Show''
and ``Spin City''? 

_ If a Hollywood studio makes a movie about the Florida election
standoff, would the title be ``It's a Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad
World''? 

_ How many readers of The Wall Street Journal noticed that an
article on Wednesday carrying the headline ``Genetically Altered
Protein Is Found in Still More Corn'' ran adjacent to an
advertisement for a golf tournament on Fox Sports sponsored by Sun
Microsystems that featured a fanciful photograph of a gigantic ear
of corn as big as a Buick? 

_ Doesn't a new television commercial for Fidelity Investments,
centered on a telephone conversation between a female employee and a
male customer, resemble a Citibank campaign from the late 1980s that
was so brilliantly parodied as the ``First Citiwide Change Bank''
commercials on ``Saturday Night Live''? 

_ Did shoppers at the New York supermarket chain Gristede's rush to
take advantage of a recent sale on the ``BIG 150-count box'' of
Scotties facial tissues, or did they recall that Scotties has
usually come in a 175-count box? 

_ Can Ocean Spray Cranberries get a refund on a full-page ad that
ran in newspapers on Nov. 8 and carried the headline ``Now That the
Election Is Over, You Can Focus on Some Real News''? 

_ Was it a coincidence that an ad for the Carnation Coffee-mate line
of coffee creamers in the recent issue of In Style Entertaining 2000
magazine ran opposite an article about ``great trends'' in
party-giving that began by describing carnations as ``the chic
flower of the moment''? 

_ Should an English teacher have been consulted before the Tropicana
division of PepsiCo produced posters that described its Pure Premium
orange juice as being ``as packed with Vitamin C as a bus on a rainy
day''? 

_ Will Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear and James L. Brooks
complain about an ad from Campbell Soup Co. for Campbell's Cream of
Mushroom soup that carried the slogan ``As m'm! m'm! good! as it
gets''? 

_ Now that the Roundabout Theater Company is calling its new
facility in Times Square the American Airlines Theater, will the
ushers give out peanuts instead of Playbills? 

_ Why did the Reader's Digest Association go to the trouble of
airbrushing the identifying information from a label on a pair of
jeans worn by a man in a photograph featured in an ad for Reader's
Digest magazine, but leave the red tab on the back pocket that tells
everyone the pants are Levi's? 

_ Do television commercials for prescription drugs disclose that
side effects in tests were no worse ``than a sugar pill'' because
research found that consumers weren't familiar with the word
``placebo''? 

_ What was in the zeitgeist that led two disparate advertisers _
Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield and the MSN network of Microsoft _ to
introduce about the same time campaigns centered on butterflies? 

_ And what was in the zeitgeist that led two automotive marketers _
Land Rover and Volvo _ to introduce about the same time commercials
centered on drivers rescuing animals on rainy roads? 

_ Are folks old enough to remember the heyday of the radio and

greeting, ``How are ya?,'' every time they hear the name of the new
Lucent Technologies spinoff company, Avaya Communication? 

_ How appealing was a recent offer made by Sprint Communications Co.
to give buyers of a Sprint PCS telephone and a calling plan a free
``pre-owned phone''? 

_ Was it an inside joke that the name of the character played by
John Corbett on ``Sex and the City,'' Aidan Shaw, was almost
identical to the name of a longtime star of gay sex films, Aiden
Shaw? 

_ How many tickets did the Houston Grand Opera sell after mailing
out a promotional brochure featuring photographs of cattle with

_ If CBS shows the first episode of ``Survivor II'' after its
broadcast of Super Bowl XXXV, will the network someday show the
first episode of ``Survivor XXXV'' after its broadcast of Super Bowl
LXVIII?

Albus (Lebanon) 11-15 (AFP) -

Thousands of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon commemorated in their
camps today Wednesday the twelfth anniversary of the symbolic
announcement of independence by the Palestinian National Council in
Algeria in 1988.


Around five thousand Palestinians form the Albus Camp near Souer (83
km south of Beirut) gathered and followed a march by children dressed
in military clothing who held stones and raised pictures of Mohamed
al-Dura, the 12-year-old Palestinian child killed by Israeli army
bullets in the Palestinian Territories in early October.


A France Presse correspondent reported that around 200 Palestinians
marched along the streets of Ayn Alhilwa refugee camp near Saida, one
of southern Lebanon's main cities, toward the headquarters of the
Fatah movement led by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat carrying
the Palestinian flag.


A group of young people burned the Israeli and American flags outside
the headquarters.


Khalid Arif, am official with the Fatah movement in Saida, said the
Intifada against Israel which started late last September and has
resulted in over two hundred deaths would "continue until the Israeli
occupiers and settlers were chased out of the Palestinian
Territories."


He added, "The Intifada will continue until a Palestinian state with
holy Jerusalem as its capital is created and the refugees return to
their homes."


In the nearby Ayn Alhilwa refugee camp, students between ages fifteen
and sixteen marched through the camp's alleyways, chanting "Jerusalem
is ours" then the burned Israeli and American flags.


Fatah movement called on Palestinians to declare today Wednesday as a
day "to embody national independence" and to stop "Israeli occupying
forces and settler bandits from entering occupied Palestinian
territory," as a commemoration of the twelfth anniversary of the
symbolic announcement of Palestinian independence.


Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had symbolically announced a
Palestinian state on November 15, 1988 in Algeria when the first
Palestinian Intifada was at its height and which continued for seven
years until the Oslo peace accords were signed in 1993.

Beirut 10-15 (AFP) -

The Saudi Soccer Federation sacked the team's Czech coach Milan
Machala from his post today Sunday and appointed his assistant,
Nasser Jawhar, in his place.


The title-holding Saudi team suffered a bitter defeat (1-4) against
its Japanese counterpart in its first match in the championship
yesterday Saturday.


The Youth and Sports Bureau in Saudi Arabia released a statement
saying: "Prince Sultan Ben Fahd, president of the Youth and Sports
Bureau and president of the Saudi Soccer Federation, has issued a
decision by order of which Czech coach Machala has been discharged
and Nasser Jawhar has been placed in charge of training the team
during the championship."


He carried on: "This decision is the result of the Saudi Federation
ensuring the best technical conditions for the team in order to
reflect the true level of Saudi soccer."


In a telephone call with Agence France Presse at his hotel, Machala
refused to give his opinion regarding the decision and said "no
comment."


Machala is the first victim of the 12th Asian Nations Cup finals
hosted by Lebanon until this October 29 as the Japanese blow was
fatal, especially since the Saudi team holds the title from the
previous series in the Emirates in 1996.


Machala took over training the Saudi team in February 1999 and led it
in the Continents Championship hosted by Mexico in July of that year.


Machala is considered one of the best-known coaches in the Gulf
region and has achieved remarkable results with the Kuwaiti team,
which he led to win the Gulf Cup on two occasions and to take fourth
place in the last Asian Nations Championship in the Emirates, as well
as second place in the Asian Games in Bangkok in late 1998.

American President Bill Clinton attempted today Wednesday to reassure
money markets about doubts caused by the battle between the
Republicans and Democrats on the result of the presidential elections
in the United States, which is still unknown and dependent on the
results of the recount in the State of Florida.


Clinton told a group of businessmen on the periphery of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Brunei that "one of the
issues both Vice-President Al Gore and Governor George Bush agree on
in these elections is the need to maintain a strong and pioneering
role by the United States in order to achieve flourishing trade and
greater integration for the world's economy [...] and the world
should not be concerned because the two candidates are strongly
committed to following this path."


The American stock market saw an upheaval as a result of the delay in
announcing the final results of the presidential elections in the
United States but it improved on Tuesday.


Initial results in Florida on Tuesday evening showed Republican
candidate George Bush to be 300 votes ahead of Democrat candidate Al
Gore but some voting stations were still recounting votes today
Wednesday.


In Brunei, President Clinton refused to make any predications about
who might win the presidency in this exceptional election battle
between the Democratic and Republican candidates.


He said "we must be careful when we talk about predictions; the only
thing I can predict with confidence is that I will not be taking part
in the next Apec summit next year and at present, I can't say who
will be representing the United States."

Bandar Seri Begawan 11-15 (AFP) -

A Japanese official announced today Wednesday that Japan and Russia
are to hold a summit before the end of the current year in an attempt
to find a solution to their dispute about the Coral Islands, which
has hindered the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries
since the end of World War II.


The decision to hold the summit was made during the meeting between
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori on the periphery of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Brunei.


The Japanese official said that those responsible had "agreed to meet
at Irkotsik (east Russia) before the end of the year.


In 1997, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister
Riotaro Hashimoto agreed to sign the peace treaty before the end of
2000, but negotiations have not progressed much since then.


Russia and Japan have been unable to sign a peace agreement since
1945 because of their dispute concerning four of the Coral islands
located between Russia and Japan and which were invaded by Russian
forces in the last few days of World War II.


Putin visited Japan last September but the visit did not produce any
result on the issue of the islands.

The United States today Wednesday deemed the order issued by
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat for a ceasefire in territories
under Palestinian Authority control as a positive gesture but
considered that it does not release constitute a release form the
terms of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement.


James Stewart, the White House's spokesman in Bandar Seri Begawan,
the capital of the Sultanate of Brunei which American President Bill
Clinton is visiting, said "of course we positively welcome the
announcement aimed at stopping the violence. But the important point
is that Palestinian and Israeli officials take the right steps to
provide a safer climate in the whole region."


Clinton is to take part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum (APEC) in Brunei.


The American spokesman said President Bill Clinton spoke to Arafat on
the telephone after arriving in Brunei yesterday evening Tuesday.

He said "their conversation focused on ways to stop the violence
because we believe that it is extremely important for the sides to
take immediate measures to end the tension and reduce the violence."
